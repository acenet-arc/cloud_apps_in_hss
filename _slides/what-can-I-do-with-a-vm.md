* What can I do with a computer?
  * Desktop GUI, watch movies, listen to music, browse the web<br/>(possible, but maybe your laptop would be better?)
  * Store data, host websites, run web-scrapers<br/>(probably better on a VM)
* What are researchers doing on CC clouds?
  * Scrape data from web (e.g. [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/), [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/),[Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/))
    * Run programs at scheduled times (e.g. [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron))
  * File sharing/storage (e.g. [Globus](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/Globus), [sftp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol), [http](https://httpd.apache.org/))
  * Running web-servers
