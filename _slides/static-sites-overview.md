* Static sites are the original websites (HTML in the 1980s-1990s)
* Static files not generated by web-server
* Suitable when one set of content for all visitors is acceptable
* Can have dynamic elements using [javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* Traditionally hand crafted by web-developers
* More recently there are static website generators
  * Create static files from [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
  * Use either pre-made or custom themes
  * Custom themes require html/css/javascript knowledge
* Popular static website generators:
  * [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/)
