* But I am not a bank do I need to worry?
  * **Yes!**<br/>Botnets/hackers want control as many machines as possible
  * Allowing them to perform larger distributed attacks
* Some examples of personal experience:
  * My first Linux server
    * SSH brute-force attacks in the logs
  * Several successful SSH brute-force attacks on CC cloud VMs
  * A Drupal site I helped administer was hacked (and then rebuilt)
* Are their alternatives to dynamic websites?
