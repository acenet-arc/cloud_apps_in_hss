* If you don't need a dynamic website don't use one
* You might need a dynamic website if:
  * Visitors need to create content
  * Unique personalized information needs to be displayed
* Static websites:
  * Easy to backup; save your source folder
  * Easy to migrate; save generated HTML to your desktop
  * Easy to keep entire site under version control (e.g. [git](https://git-scm.com/))
  * Easy to setup (no SSL, no databases)
